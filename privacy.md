## Information we collect

We collect information in the following ways:

* **Account and profile information.** When you sign up for a WakaTime account,
  we store information such as your email address. This will never be shared
  publicly without your consent.
* **Billing information.** We collect billing address and credit card
  information if you purchase a premium version of WakaTime. Billing address
  and credit card information is securely passed to our payment processing
  partner and is not stored at WakaTime.
* **Plugin usage content.** We collect and store the timestamps, file names,
  domain names, machine host names, project names, branch names, editor names
  and versions, syntax languages, and detected dependencies from your usage of
  our [downloadable plugins][editors]. Except for syntax languages, editor
  names, and detected dependency data, this information will never be shared
  publicly without your consent. We display the syntax languages, editor names,
  and detected dependencies on your public profile.
* **Service integrations.** If you [integrate with a service][integrations] on
  WakaTime we will connect that service to ours. We do not receive or store
  your passwords or source code for any of these services. You can remove an
  integration at any time which unbinds that integration on a go-forward basis.
  That does not, however, delete the content that was received from them and
  indexed within WakaTime. That content must be deleted manually.
* **Usage information.** We may collect information about the services you use
  and how you use them, like which pages you visit and which features you use.
  We use cookies with unique identifiers to authenticate your login session.
  Third parties, including but not limited to Google Analytics, may also use
  cookies to track your return visits to the website.

## How we use information we collect

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and protect services
for our users. We may also use this information to improve your
user-experience with our services.
We will ask for your consent before using any of your information for a
purpose other than set out in this Privacy Policy.

When you contact WakaTime, we may keep a record of your name and email address
to better solve any customer issues.
We may use your name and email address to inform you about our services, such
as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.

## Information we share

We do not share your personal information with organizations, companies, or
individuals outside of WakaTime unless one of the following circumstances
apply:

* **With your consent.** We will share information with organizations,
  companies, or individuals outside of WakaTime when we have your
  permission to do so.
* **For legal reasons.** We will share information with organizations,
  companies, or individuals outside of WakaTime if necessary to:
  - Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or government
    request.
  - Enforce applicable Terms of Service.
  - Detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues.

## Information security

We work hard to protect your private information. We enforce SSL when our users
communicate with WakaTime. We use a [one-way hash algorithm][bcrypt] with
random salt to store your password.

We use a third party, [Stripe][stripe], to store your credit card information
and process payments. Your credit card information is never stored or
transmitted using our servers. We only store the last 4 digits, expiration
date, and card type of your credit card on our servers for reference. Your
credit card information is governed by
[Stripe's Privacy Policy][stripe privacy].

## Changes

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to
this Policy from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically
to check for updates. If the changes are significant, we may notify you or
provide an additional opportunity to "opt-in", as appropriate.
